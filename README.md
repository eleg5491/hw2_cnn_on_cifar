# ELEG5491 A2 Programming - CNN on CIFAR

A simple CNN implementation for image classification. We use PyTorch framework and the installation is detailed on the 
[official website](http://pytorch.org/).

## How to submit your code

Please write an `.ipynb` file including all your code/figure/necessary(and brief!) comments. An example of iPython notebook is [here](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/Reinforcement%20(Q-)Learning%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb). The installation of python notebook is [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

You can use Amazon AWS web service to launch GPU mode if you do not have it in local computer.

Submit your notebook file to the elearning-system before A2 deadline. **NOTE** that the derivation of theory part in Problem 5 has to be written alongside with other problems; no need to write it again in the notebook.
